Assignment briefing

Imagine you are a recent graduate who has decided to build a start-up company working on decision systems for engineering design. Your first potential client is a company working on a new type of electric-powered vehicle. While their team is capable of designing the new powertrain, they have limited experience in designing the rest of the vehicle: for example they need to implement a suitable controller for their propulsion system and are not sure how it might affect the dynamic performance of the vehicle, including its energy efficiency.

Your task is to convince them that your start-up company is perfectly suited to help them in the decision making process. To do that, they have asked you to prepare a report to highlight the capabilities of the tools you are proposing to use. Because at this stage they are reluctant to share their Simulink models, your pilot study will focus on tuning the gains for a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller, such that a feedback control system satisfies a set of requirements.

The system to be controlled, and the performance criteria against which a set of controller gains are assessed, are described in the Laboratory A instructions. The goals for the performance criteria are given in the instructions for Laboratory B.

During Laboratory A, you will learn about the relationships between the design variables and the performance criteria for the given system. In Laboratory B, you will attempt to optimize the gains to meet the goals for the performance criteria.

Following these laboratories, you need to write a report that would appeal to both the CEO of your potential client and their Chief Engineer. Assignment Project Exam HelpAs you write, you will have further time to explore the

managed to achieve, explaining any challenges encountered in satisfying all the requirements, and making recommendations for tuning options.

Your report should be structured as follows:

Title page including Executive Summary (1 page)

Summarise the outcomes of the tuning process and recommendations for PI gain settings in under 300 words. This section does not contribute to the page limit for the report.

Section 1: Multi-objective optimization for Engineering Design (2 pages)

Write a brief introduction to Decision Systems for Engineering Design. Explain how it compares with other approaches used in decision making and give five examples from the literature where it has been used for electric vehicle design. Draw a comparison between the main three approaches to solving multi-objective optimization problems; explain the main differences in their approach to find a candidate approximation set.

Section 2: Problem Formulation (1 page)

Express the problem in formal mathematical terms.

Section 3: Sampling Plan (2 pages)

Show at least three different sampling plans and analyse their space-filling performance. Identify a sampling plan to take forward.

Section 4: Knowledge Discovery (2 pages)

Use the evaluations from the chosen sampling plan to describe the relationships between the design variables and performance criteria.

Section 5: Optimization Process (2 pages)

Describe the optimization approach used and how goals were incorporated into the process.

Section 6: Optimization Results (2 pages)

Show the results of the optimization process, indicating whether or not the goals have been met, and the quantitative trade-offs inherent to the problem.

Section 7: Sustainability Analysis (1 page)

Highlight the trade-offs between minimising energy usage and meeting the other goals for transient performance. Assess the implications for transient performance if the control effort goal were to be tightened to 0.63 MJ. Discuss potential changes to powertrain hardware or controller architecture that might help mitigate any performance issues.

Section 8: Recommendations (1 page)

Based on the knowledge discovery and optimization results, make recommendations for PI controller options for consideration by the Chief Engineer.

Section 9: Conclusions (1 page)

Link the results of your study with the vehicle propulsion problem your client is keen to solve. How would you apply the same methodology for their problem? Indicate at least two other decision systems tools that you propose to use to help them in their design problem.
